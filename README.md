# LinearRegression
This Python script implements a linear regression model using the Scikit-Learn library. It is part of my Python training at BUET, demonstrating the application of linear regression for predicting continuous outcomes. The code covers essential steps like data preprocessing, fitting the model to the dataset, and evaluating its performance.
